## Light House Server

This is a RaspberryPi + Node.js project. It started out as a simple controller for the lights in my house but it turned into Frankenstein...

I'm not sure if this project can help someone but if it does, feel free to clone! It's all just a collection of Open Source projects anyway:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): It does everything so it rocks.
2. [mochad](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mochad/index.php?title=Main_Page) CLI: simple control of incandescent lights through X10.
3. [socket.io](http://socket.io/): For a super-fast chat room. It's very similar to the [Cloud9](http://c9.io) example Node.js app.
4. [gmaps](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/): Dead-simple Google maps API.
5. [jQueryFileUpload](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/): Now it's a file server too with nice image previews.
